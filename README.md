# TrafficLightDemo
Kinect + Traffic Light demonstration for Wisconsin Robotics outreach events.

See release v0.1.0 from 2021 for old C# executable (including gesture recognition) or "Kinect Multi Display.py" for a python replacement that visualizes depth and ir image separately (but no gesture recognition).
